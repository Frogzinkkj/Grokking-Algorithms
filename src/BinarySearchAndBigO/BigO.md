### Logic
![Complexity Graph](/src/assets/BigO.jpg)

- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.

- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.

- O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.

- O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.

- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson
